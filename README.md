### \#6. ZigZag conversion
**LeetCode Link:**

[https://leetcode.com/problems/zigzag-conversion/](https://leetcode.com/problems/zigzag-conversion/)

**Problem description:**

The string `"PAYPALISHIRING"` is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fiexd font for better legibility)
```
  P   A   H   N
  A P L S I I G
  Y   I   R
```
And then read line by line: `"PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"`

### \#22. Merge Two Sorted Lists
**LeetCode Link:**

[https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)

**Problem description:**

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

### \#32. Count and Say
**LeetCode Link:**

[https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/)

**Problem description:**

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers beginning as follows:

`1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, ...`

**Source code:**

[https://github.com/BobyZhang/LeetCode/blob/master/LeetCodeSolution/%2332Count_and_Say.cpp](https://github.com/BobyZhang/LeetCode/blob/master/LeetCodeSolution/%2332Count_and_Say.cpp)

**Detail:**



### \#88. Merge Sorted Array
**LeetCode Link:**

[https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/)

**Problem description:**

Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.

*Note*: You may assume that nums1 has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2. The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n respectively.

**Source code:**

**Detail:**


### \#121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
**LeetCode Link:**

https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/

**Problem description:**

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

**Source code:**

[https://github.com/BobyZhang/LeetCode/blob/master/LeetCodeSolution/%23121Best_Time_to_Buy_and_Sell_Stock.cpp](https://github.com/BobyZhang/LeetCode/blob/master/LeetCodeSolution/%23121Best_Time_to_Buy_and_Sell_Stock.cpp)

**Detail:**

This is a `Dynamic Programing`. Iteration may time excced, so must use recurrence.

### \#169. Majority Element
**LeetCode Link:**

[https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/)

**Problem description:**

Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊ n/2 ⌋` times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

**Source code:**

[https://github.com/BobyZhang/LeetCode/blob/master/LeetCodeSolution/%23169Majority_Element.cpp](https://github.com/BobyZhang/LeetCode/blob/master/LeetCodeSolution/%23169Majority_Element.cpp)

**Detail:**

*Warming*: qsort just use in array, not POD or any struct.
